1)LineraRegression : 
      In my Machine Learning Assignment - Task 01, I successfully implemented a linear regression📉 model to predict house prices based on square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms 🏠📈. By working on this task, I gained hands-on experience in applying linear regression for predictive modeling, exploring feature engineering with numerical data, and evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy and error rates 🤔. I demonstrated skills in data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, feature engineering, and regression analysis 📊. Notably, I utilized popular libraries like scikit-learn, NumPy 🇳 , Pandas 🐼, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to develop the model 🤖. The datasets were imported from Kaggle, providing a real-world context to the project 📊. Overall, this task solidified my understanding of machine learning fundamentals and practical implementation 🛠️👨🏻‍💻 

2)K-means Clustering : 
      Machine Learning Assignment - Task 02 🤖! I developed a K-means clustering algorithm to group retail store customers based on their purchase history 🛍. I learned how to apply clustering techniques for customer segmentation, data preprocessing, and model evaluation 🤔. I demonstrated skills in data analysis, feature engineering, and unsupervised learning 📊. Plus, I got to work with popular libraries like scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas🐼, and Matplotlib 🤖, and datasets imported from Kaggle 📊! By clustering customers, I discovered meaningful patterns in their purchase behavior, enabling data-driven insights for the retail store 📈.

3)Support Vector Machine:
      Machine Learning Assignment - Task 03 🤖

In this task, I implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset 🐈🐕. I learned how to apply SVM algorithms for image classification, feature engineering, and model evaluation 🤔. I demonstrated skills in data preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning 📊. Plus, I got to work with popular libraries like scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib 🤖, and datasets imported from Kaggle 📊! This project showcases my abilities in machine learning and computer vision 📸.
