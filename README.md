1)LineraRegression : 
      In my Machine Learning Assignment - Task 01, I successfully implemented a linear regression📉 model to predict house prices based on square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms 🏠📈. By working on this task, I gained hands-on experience in applying linear regression for predictive modeling, exploring feature engineering with numerical data, and evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy and error rates 🤔. I demonstrated skills in data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, feature engineering, and regression analysis 📊. Notably, I utilized popular libraries like scikit-learn, NumPy 🇳 , Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to develop the model 🤖. The datasets were imported from Kaggle, providing a real-world context to the project 📊. Overall, this task solidified my understanding of machine learning fundamentals and practical implementation 🛠️👨🏻‍💻 

2)K-means Clustering : 
      
3)Support Vector Machine
4)CNN
